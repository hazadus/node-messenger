## App Setup in Dev Environment

Run `npm install` in both `backend` and `frontend` directories to install the dependencies.

### Backend

Create `backend/.env` with the following environment variables:

```
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:30001/messenger?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=true&w=majority&directConnection=true"
```

Generate Prisma client (from **backend** directory): `make prisma_generate`.

Then `npm run dev` to run the app using `nodemon`.

### Frontend

Create `frontend/.env.local` with the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_HOST="localhost:4000"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<Generate using `openssl rand -base64 32` command>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<Get it in the Google Cloud Console>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Get it in the Google Cloud Console>
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:30001/messenger?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=true&w=majority&directConnection=true"
```

Generate Prisma client (from **frontend** directory): `make prisma_generate`.

Do `chmod +x ./frontend/docker/initiate_replica.sh`, then `docker compose up -d` to run our very own MongoDB Replica Set. Then `npm run dev` to run the app.

## Running App on the Server

Add app domain to Authorized origins in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) -> APIs & Services -> Credentials.

Create `frontend/.env` file with the following variables:

```
# Domain where app is deployed:
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_HOST="messenger.hazadus.ru:4000"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://messenger.hazadus.ru"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<Generate using `openssl rand -base64 32` command>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<Get it in the Google Cloud Console>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<Get it in the Google Cloud Console>
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://mongodb1:27017/messenger?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=true&w=majority&directConnection=true"
```

Next.js will insert `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_HOST` value into `frontend/src/graphql/apollo-client.ts` during build time.

Note that we use `mongodb1:27017` for MongoDB ‚Äì service name from Docker Compose and internal port number.

To configure backend, you should set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`, e.g. `CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://messenger.hazadus.ru`.

Run `docker compose up -d` from the base app directory.
